It suggest improvements for any income 5.

The presenters were all well-spoken and knowledgeable on the topics that they were delivering.  I especially liked the cameo appearances of Professor Tall Bear and her brief lectures on Genetics and Indigenous Feminism.  I believe that a lot of time and effort were put into the lessons, but I think more focus is needed on some of the quiz questions.  Assessments should consist of the main ideas the lecturer is focused on and what they want the students to take away from the lesson; not something that is not significant or barely mentioned.  It was difficult to decide on what notes to take, as the lecturer could have spent a significant time discussing a subtopic and there was nothing on the quiz about that subtopic.  As an educator, I would probably use about 50% of the questions.  Also, there were “glitches” with the technology, as several times the quiz would “freeze” and when I tried to click the screen would eventually work but the click would change an answer (depending on where I had the mouse) or submit it when I was not finished.  This happened 3-4 times.  Thankfully, we could try again.  ','2020-08-15','4','3283','indigenous-canada');

All in all, I have gained great value from this course and am extremely happy to have taken it. ','2020-04-06','5','3755','machine-learning');

in the course has so far surpassed my expectations. Learning isn’t always fun, sometimes while learning you get stuck on ideas that you cannot seem to figure out. However, through persistence and observing simple learning rules it becomes worthwhile.A very big thank you to Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski for this amazing, explicit, detailed yet concise course. I have learned so much from you. A lot of concepts have become clearer and my passion for learning in another dimension has been ignited.Having listened to Benny Lewis on the subject of leaning languages in his interview with Barbara Oakley during the course of this lesson, my passion was re-ignited. He opined that the best way to learn a language is to speak without the fear of making mistakes, this is because paying so much attention to mistakes will inhibit the learning process and might dampen the learner’s interest. I have resolved that no matter what it takes, sooner than I had expected, I would begin to speak the Spanish, the language of  dreams fluently.I would like to use this opportunity to reach out to anyone reading this who are bilingual in English and Spanish to help a friend. I want to speak it more often. It would be nice to Speak Español with you🤗.I can be reached on igenozanic@yahoo.comNicholas Igenoza.','2020-08-27','5','4242','learning-how-to-learn');

Prior to this class, I had zero Python experience; however, my review will be biased because not only am I a graduate of University of Michigan, but I also have 30+ years of software experience including Structured Text (CoDeSys), C, C++, C#, and a half-dozen others.Professor Severance is a great teacher – I wish I could have had him as a professor during my years at U of M.Four-point-nine-star review: because I find a few things lacking in these introductory software courses, and this one in particular.Development and debugging: line by line stepping through our code using a “better” software tool. Atom and the IDLE tools are VERY lacking in development capabilities.It is fundamental to software development to be able to step through your code, line by line, set breakpoints, and easily examine variables and values as they change. And I believe this would make it MUCH more clear to new software students exactly what a CPU is doing when processing code.I know the video course tried very hard to “sketch” out what is really going on in While loops, For loops, If-then-else statements, and function calls. However, I think that students, especially students new to software overall, would benefit greatly if they could use a more professional tool than the Atom and IDLE tools. And if that’s not possible, I think the videos should show the actual animation of stepping through line-by-line and setting breakpoints in example software, using such a tool.Visual Studio Community version is FREE online, and has all these capabilities. I’m not promoting Microsoft or this tool, other than it’s an excellent example of the types of tools students should use for really learning software. And they will benefit greatly from this experience when they evolve to the professional level.And two footnotes about Python:(a) Implicit conversion from int to float, and(b) indentation.These are my main “beefs” against Python; in the 21st century, implicit conversions should never be allowed. And the fact that Python 3 (not Python 2) implicitly converts integers to floats during mathematical operations will bar it from being an enterprise professional language. Indentation instead of braces or other blocking methods: over and over again students will be stumped as to why their code does not work because tabs and spaces are being mingled in the code. A professional language should not do that. Indeed, one must carefully make sure the settings convert tabs to spaces.  ','2020-08-26','5','4482','python');

I learned how to decide the hypothesis, how decide the polynomials, how to decide parameters, how to decide threshold value (instead of guessing[Classification Problems]), how to choose and/or synthesis features and many more.5.

I train teachers how to combine effective teaching practices with technology in K-8 classrooms. There is lots of room for improvement in this course. I would not recommend it to someone with no experience. I have no experience in coding, and did well in this course because I went to other sources to answer my questions and fill the knowledge gaps in this course. Though the instructor was great. He seems very passionate.From a teaching/pedagogy standpoint the scope and sequence was poor. It went from extremely broad (defining computer parts) to hyper specific (defining variables in python) really quick. There was no information between on the practical pieces of what python is, what it looks like on our computer, and how we interact with it.It feels like multiple people got together to build the course, but after it was finished they never came back to say “Here’s where we didn’t communicate, let’s edit these things.”There is a HUGE disconnect between writing python programs and running them vs. running the actual python platform and typing commands line by line. The most frustrating thing was that every example in the course was given as a line of code in the python platform with the chevron prompt, and every single assignment was about writing a program in the text editor and the running the program. I didn’t realize these were two completely different things until about week 6. PLEASE ADDRESS THIS. Make it clear for future students that this is a thing. Go over how to use both, and the benefits and drawbacks of each. Make it clear that your examples are taking place in the command line python platform, but our homework is writing programs and saving and running them. I didn’t understand the use of the ‘type’ function until I realized this discrepancy. This was so confusing.Some of the quiz questions were very specific questions that were mentioned for about a second or never explicitly made clear. Some of the ideas that were emphasized or mentioned multiple times in the same lecture video (seemed important) were never asked on the quiz. I can give examples of both. I learned some stuff, but overall I would not recommend this course without pointing to the discrepancies. I would say there are multiple obvious areas for improvement and multiple gaps in knowledge that I filled from other sources. I could give more specific examples, but I feel like I already wrote quite a bit.','2019-01-21','2','7870','python');

The concepts and techniques taught here should be required by every teacher and student in our school systems from kindergarten on.  Of course, some of the material is well beyond the grasp of a kindergartner, but the techniques and methods can be taught by how their teacher manages the delivery of curriculum.   It is never too early to teach our children how to learn.This is a wonderfully succinct presentation of key concepts that I wish had been available to me in my youth.   I was very fortunate to have an anatomy and physiology professor in college in 1979 that took time in his lectures to teach about how the brain learns and some methods and principles for study, retention, and recall.   I saw many of his concepts in this course.I later went on to teach college myself.   I found the students in my Freshman course on data communications were particularly lazy about making an effort to learn material thoroughly.   I knew this bad habit would hinder their progress in the semesters to come.I adopted a practice of making my mid-term exam a thorough (not to be confused with level of difficulty) test of their understanding.  Consequently, 60% would fail that test.   When delivering the bad news I also delivered a path to recovering from that score.   I provide several hours of lecture on what I learned about learning from my A&P professor.   Then I offered a retest.   The questions were posed differently in wording and type (multiple choice vs short answer essay vs T/F).  Everyone improved their score significantly and the pass/fail distribution reflected more of a bell curve distribution.Interestingly, when I tried teach how to learn before the mid-term I still saw a 60% failure rates.   I expect somethings require more motivation.   The risk of failing a course proved to be motivating, so I capitalized on that human behavior.   I wish I could have found a better way, because this approach cost several lecture hours of data communications instruction.   However, teaching them to learn proved so much more valuable.I, unexpectedly had the same high failure rate on a term test teach an Algebra class.   I responded in kind with lectures on how to learn.   On student that started with failing the first term test almost dropped.   Another student that had taken other classes encouraged her stay on and to learn how to learn.   She finish Algebra with an A-.   At the end of the course she came to me with the most treasured compliment of my teach career, "You taught me that I can learn anything I want to learn."','2016-03-13','5','8133','learning-how-to-learn');

This course has truly opened my eyes.

As a friend recently said to me, "We can only do better when we know better" and with that in mind I promise to advocate strongly, loudly and fiercely on behalf of the First Nations community for their rights which have been denied far too long.

I suppose this is intentional to make the students learn to find things out themselves. I downloaded the exercises as Excel workbooks. The exercises are very well thought out. I thought the instructors would have Australian accent and I would have problem understanding them. I was wrong. They spoke perfect American English with no accent.
